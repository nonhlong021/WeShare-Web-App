Expenses
An expense is anything that you spent money on. All you are interested in recording is what you spent your hard-earned money on, when you spent it and how much you spent.

PAYMENT REQUESTS

Sometimes, you might go out with some friends and, maybe, pay on behalf of someone else. The person you paid for then owes you some money back. In this app, you record the amount you paid as an expense, and you make a payment request for the share of that expense from the friend that you helped.

For example, say you go for lunch with two friends and they’re short of cash. As a group of friends at the lunch, you offer to pay the for lunch on condition that your friends pay you back. Let’s say that the lunch came to R300 in total, and one friend owes you R80 and the other owes you R120. So you log on to the app and record your lunch expense for the lunch. Then, for the lunch expense you make two payment requests: one for R80, and the other for R120.

PAYMENTS

A payment request is paid by the person who received the payment request to the person that sent the payment request. When payment request is paid, the payment becomes an expense for the person that made the payment. Then, the expense of the person that sent the payment request is reduced by the amount paid back.
